The project is composed of a sugar cane plant, located in the city of João Pinheiro in the state of Minas Gerais,
Brazil.

The Bevap project was born with 3 machines registered with Bevap, with powers of 25/25/30 MW
(see ordinance PRT2009126 MME).

Subsequently, Bevap decided to create Enervale, which, in lending, acquired the right to use the
condensation machine (UG3), purchasing steam from Bevap.

Subsequently, the UG1 turbine underwent retrofitting, changing its power from 25 MW to 30 MW
With this, they established the two generating UTEs, granted by resolutions REA20112925 (Bevap
– 60MW) and REA20123439 (Enervale – 30 MW).
