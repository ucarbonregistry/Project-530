The project is composed of a sugar cane plant, located in the city of João Pinheiro in the state of Minas Gerais,
Brazil.

The Bevap project was born with 3 machines registered with Bevap, with powers of 25/25/30 MW
(see ordinance PRT2009126 MME).

Subsequently, Bevap decided to create Enervale, which, in lending, acquired the right to use the
condensation machine (UG3), purchasing steam from Bevap.

Subsequently, the UG1 turbine underwent retrofitting, changing its power from 25 MW to 30 MW
With this, they established the two generating UTEs, granted by resolutions REA20112925 (Bevap
– 60MW) and REA20123439 (Enervale – 30 MW).

The purpose of the activity is to generate electricity using renewable biomass (sugarcane bagasse,
which is the residue from the juice extraction process for the production of ethanol and sugar), and,
thus, reduce GHG emissions by displacing fossil fuel in grid-based electricity.
It is a grid-connected biomass cogeneration power plant with a high-pressure steam-turbine
configuration. The high-pressure boilers are fired by bagasse to generate steam which in turn is fed
to the steam turbine to generate power. The power co-generation units generate biomass-based power
for captive consumption of the sugar plant and the sale of surplus power to the Brazilian electricity
grid.

The UCR Project activity is the construction and operation of power plants/units that use renewable
energy sources and supplies renewable electricity to the grid. The UCR project activity is thus the
displacement of electricity that would be provided to the grid by more-GHG-intensive means and
provides long-term benefits to the mitigation of climate change. The UCR project activity qualifies
under the environmental additional positive list of pre-approved project types under the UCR carbon
incentive model for issuance of voluntary carbon credits.

The activity currently consumes more of 800 thousand tons of biomass for generation clean energy
and produces more than 270,000 MWh of electrical energy per year and, of this total, and 150,000
MWh are injected into the Brazilian electrical system, enough to supply a city of approximately
69,000 inhabitants, and thereby contributes to climate change mitigation efforts.
